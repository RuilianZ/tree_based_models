## Question 1

``` r
set.seed(0409)

# data import and cleaning
df = read_csv("College.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-college) %>% 
  select(outstate, everything()) %>% 
  na.omit()

# data partition
indexTrain = createDataPartition(y = df$outstate,
                                 p = 0.8,
                                 list = FALSE)


train_df = df[indexTrain, ]
test_df = df[-indexTrain, ]

x_train = model.matrix(outstate ~ ., train_df)[ , -1]
y_train = train_df$outstate

x_test = model.matrix(outstate ~ ., test_df)[ , -1]
y_test = test_df$outstate
```

1.  Build a regression tree on the training data to predict the
    response. Create a plot of the tree.
